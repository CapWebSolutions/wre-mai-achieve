                    Luxury Homes in Downtown Greenville, South Carolina<br>
                    Livability has recently ranked downtown Greenville as one of the “Top 10 Best Downtowns” in the country, and The New York Times called Greenville “a national model for a pedestrian-friendly city center.” With wide sidewalks, outdoor plazas, and street-side dining, downtown Greenville offers a pedestrian-friendly
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, Greenville now has a strong 3,000 to 4,000-person downtown residential sector. Consequently, the downtown Greenville residential real estate market is booming, offering luxury condos, apartments, and lofts, as well as luxury single family homes for sale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These luxury condos and apartments in Greenville offer upscale living in addition to the many amenities that we all love; amenities such as swimming pools, fitness centers, rooftop terraces, covered parking, concierge services, doormen, and so much more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, there are many luxury single family homes in the downtown area, and they too offer conveniences such as proximity to downtown, gated communities, seclusion and privacy, private tennis courts, bocce courts, playgrounds, parks, putting greens, shopping and so much more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you think about all there is to love about downtown Greenville, it is exciting to know that it can all be enjoyed from the comfort and elegance of your luxury home!

                <h2>Luxury Neighborhoods in Greenville</h2>
                <p>
                    Greenville boast a variety of architectural options, such as Victorian, Italian, Georgian, Greek Revival, Modern, Craftsman, Bungalow-style homes, and many more. When searching for any style home in Greenville, you will quickly find that there are several scenic, luxury neighborhoods offering tight-knit communities, quality schools, and stunning homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These luxury neighborhoods also provide historic charm, privacy, and family-oriented activities, allowing residents to enjoy an unmatched, grand Southern living experience. You will also find some of the most diverse, as well as handsome structures, in addition to large historic homes, lush parks, small business districts, and plenty of community events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Greenville Luxury Home Market is Hot.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are lot of luxury homes for sale in the Greenville SC area.  And surprisingly they are selling at a faster pace that I thought possible!  You see folks, it just wasn’t that way when I moved to Greenville 32 years ago…. Back then you had some luxury homes for sale in neighborhoods like Chanticleer, areas off Roper Mt. Rd or perhaps close to downtown Greenville just to mention a few.  But now luxurious homes seem to be all over the Greenville SC area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what defines a luxury home in Greenville?  You know folks, it’s all relative.  What a local might see as luxurious someone from out of the area might find simple. I’ve got to pick a price so let’s say anything above $500,000 would qualify as a luxury home.  And remember, you get a lot more for your money when you buy a home in the Greenville SC area.  And you also get a lot less tax bill!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Old Greenville Luxury Neighborhoods
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I mentioned Chanticleer as a luxury home area.  Chanticleer is located at Greenville Country Club and has quite a bit of expensive homes especially “behind the gate”. This is old Greenville mixed with newcomers who want to play on one of the top 100 golf courses in the US and top 10 in SC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I mentioned Roper Mt. Rd as there are plenty of neighborhoods and homes that would qualify as luxurious.  Some of the homes on Roper Mt. Rd. are very extravagant with huge lots.  As a matter of fact I believe one of the most expensive homes in Greenville SC is located just across from Cobblestone. Luxury neighborhoods in this area would include Claremont, Cobblestone, Kilgore Plantation, Thornblade and Kingsbridge (video tour).
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally what is luxury in Downtown Greenville?  Well, just about anywhere look you can find an extravagant condo or two…  you can easily spend a couple of millions dollars on one of these luxury homes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another area that is close to Greenville area is the North Main area. Same thing as the Augusta Rd. Area with renovations and luxurious new builds. From there you would look further to the suburbs of Greenville.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’d suggest looking in Alta Vista, Barrington Park, Chanticleer at Greenville Country Club, Cobbleston in Simpsonville, Hartness, Kingsbridge, Montebello, Parking Mill, Southampton and Thornblade just to name a few.

                    <h2>The Greenville Real Estate Market</h2>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="main_content_wrap">
                <p>The real estate market in Greenville South Carolina has been on a steady climb over the last 4 years but suddenly we are in a tight squeeze. The reason is that there is a high demand for homes in Greenville SC combined with a low amount of real estate inventory. What happened?</p>
                <p>Over the last 35 years that I’ve been in Greenville I have seen a great many positive changes that have occurred that has resulted in Greenville being one of the top places in the US to live! I’d like to give you a brief history of my experience and what drives the real estate market in Greenville.</p>
                <p>When I moved to Greenville 35 or so years ago it was a sleepy little town with not much going on. I remember when I first pulled up on Main St. at the Hyatt. Yep, that was it, the Hyatt. That’s about all there was in Greenville at the time except a few small stores and Charlies Steak House. A lot of space was empty and moving out to the Haywood Mall seemed the thing to do.</p>
                <p>But before I got here there was a fellow who took over as mayor named Max Heller. I’d say he had the most influence in driving the development of Greenville SC and turning it into the gem of the South that it is.</p>
                <p>Well Max got it started but there had to be more influences that came together to drive the momentum in Greenville and the resulting incredible real estate market. By far the biggest event that drove the upward tick in the real estate market was BMW manufacturing locating in Upstate SC.</p>
                <p>In 1992 BMW announced that they would build a manufacturing facility over 1,000 acres in the Upstate. The plant opened in 1992 and has over they years had multiple expansions of close to $500,000,000 each. The impact of this facility and resulting support industries had been measurable in not only the Greenville economy but the real estate market.</p>
                <p>In addition to this the Greenville Chamber of Commerce has been wildly successful in recruiting businesses to the area. In just the last year Greenville saw over $6 Billion dollars of economic impact from development and over 65,000 jobs in Greenville County alone. Folks, that drives a lot of people to want to make Greenville home.</p>
                <p>But Greenville is more than business. If you really want to know what drives the real estate market in Greenville, well it’s Greenville. It’s the wonderful schools like the Governor’s School for the Performing Arts or A J Whittenberg Elementary School of Engineering. It’s the developing Unity Park or any of the wonderful neighborhoods like Augsta Rd and the North Main area. It’s all the things you can see and do in downtown Greenville SC. I’ve described it best over the years as a big small town. Plenty to do and see without the large crowds of the big cities! Greenville, it’s a way of life!</p>
                <h2>Greenville Real Estate Trends</h2>
                <p>
                    This year, the number of Greenville’s homes for sale are down, creating a buyers market.  Homes are spending very few days on the market and appropriately priced homes are selling for (and sometimes even above) their listing price.  It’s important that homebuyers are prepared to act quickly to obtain the house or condo they want.  Let Don Wessle, your Greenville buyers agent, help clients to make arrangements for mortgages and home inspections promptly to enable them to make solid offers that appeal to the seller. In this kind of competitive environment, the best Greenville homes for sale frequently receive multiple offers. So it gives you a competitive edge to have your financing pre-approved (or cash sale), few contingencies and a house inspector all lined up.
                </p>
                <p>
